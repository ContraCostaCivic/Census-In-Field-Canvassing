# Census-In-Field-Canvassing

One of our strategies to reach our hardest to count population is to have an “Adopt-a-Block” program. Community Based Organizations, businesses, and our faith communities can commit to canvassing census blocks that are hard to county to encourage residents to fill out their Census Forms. In order to be successful, volunteers will need to be able to track which houses they visited, if they were able to make contact, and if so, how the conversation went. Supporting a canvassing effort would help Contra Costa County achieve a complete count.
