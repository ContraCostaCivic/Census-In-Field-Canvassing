# Census-In-Field-Canvassing
Empower volunteers to help increase Census participation by creating an Adopt-a-Block system. Volunteers would electronically select a Census block to work on and then report back on their outreach efforts for that block.

One of our strategies to reach our hardest to count population is to have an “Adopt-a-Block” program. Community Based Organizations, businesses, and our faith communities can commit to canvassing census blocks that are hard to county to encourage residents to fill out their Census Forms. In order to be successful, volunteers will need to be able to track which houses they visited, if they were able to make contact, and if so, how the conversation went. Supporting a canvassing effort would help Contra Costa County achieve a complete count.


# Goal
Create a system that allows organizations to adopt blocks which they will manage the canvasing and related data collection.

# Requirements
Both organizations that manage blocks and individuls who are willing to work as canvassers need to sign-up in the system.
Provide for the approval of both organizations and individuals
Allow organizations to 
- find individuals by geographic location. I.e., find all approved voulenteers in a give zip code.
- assign individuals to one or more blocks

# The Software
The software will be both a web and mobile app
## Website
The website
- enables individuals and organizations to sign-up
- submits individuals and organizations for approval for participation
- notifies individuals and organizations when/if they are approved
Once approved - organizations
- will be able to select one or more blocks to manage
- will be able to search for and find individuals who would be a good fit for the block. For example, The organization could search for all speakers of Cantonese in a given zip code.
- will be able to assign individuals to a block

Once approved - individuals
- will be able to see there assignments
- will have access to resorces, perhaps instructional materials, that will help them perform thier task.
- will be able to download and sign-into the mobile app
